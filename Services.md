Services have additional P's
- Physical evidence

- People
- Product
- Place
- Price
- Promotion
# Physical Evidence
- The actual part of the product of service that consumers interact with
- For example, if you buy a Red Bull, you are after the contents of the can, but you 'see' everything else from the design on the can to the advertisement on the fridge
# Processes
- This is the 'act of doing' and for a service it is the most important part.
-  For example, you want a well-groomed and well presented wedding photographer, and not someone in casual wear taking photos. For goods, it can mean things like ensuring your manufacturing process is free of child labour.
# People
- People are often the 'face' of the business. You might go to McDonald's to buy food, but who do you interact with when receiving your food?
- People can make or break a service business, in particular. For a goods business, people present the business.
# Physical Evidence
- What makes you trust or doubt a business before you even try the product?
