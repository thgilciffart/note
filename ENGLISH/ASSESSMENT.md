> [!NOTE] Module A: Contemporary Possibilities 
> In this module, students extend their knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the ways that different communication technologies shape the ways that we read, navigate, understand and respond to digital, multimedia, multimodal and nonlinear texts. They develop understanding of the creative possibilities made available through these rapidly evolving technologies in the ways we communicate and represent ideas and experiences.
>  Students engage in a detailed study of one complex multimodal or digital text for example film, media or interactive narratives. To support their study, students also explore a range of texts that typically use contemporary technologies such as film, television, online news services and specific social media platforms. They apply their understanding of the nature, scope and ethical use of digital technology in their own responding and composing. Students develop a deeper appreciation and understanding of the power of communication technologies to reach a broad audience for a range of purposes and the significance of this mode of communication in a global world. Through a close study of the selected texts students appreciate the active roles of both composer (author, poet, playwright, director, designer and so on) and responder (reader, listener, viewer, an audience and so on) in controlling and choosing the reading pathways through texts. They analyse and interpret the ways composers use and manipulate a variety of aural, language and visual devices to shape our understanding of what we listen to, read or view and may explore notions of hybridity and intertextuality. Through their responding and composing students gain increasing confidence in experimenting with a range of language and visual forms and features to individually or collaboratively design and create their own multimodal or digital texts to communicate and represent their ideas; understanding the importance of creating a responsible digital footprint. Through viewing, listening or reading students analyse and assess the text’s specific features and form. They express their knowledge and understanding, clearly and concisely, using appropriate register, structure and modality. They independently and collaboratively plan, draft, appraise and refine their own responses to texts applying the conventions appropriate to form of syntax, spelling and grammar.

# Sense of disconnection 
## 7:37
- Despite the ability to be so connected via our mobile devices and the ease of access of communication. David's relationship with Margot is shown to be severely disconnected despite the appearance of being connected with a facetime call. 
- "I Thought we were going to eat dinner together" "We ate together on Monday"
- Use of the overlaying facetime call allows for Chaganty to show the lack of connection by hanging up abruptly. 
- Lack of ethical use of technology
## 10:36
- 'Dude everything is fine'
## 21:50
- 'Everything is great. Margot and I are great'
## 42:37- 47:00
- 'Trust me, it's probability better than this'
- 'My dad doesn't know I stopped going to piano. He wouldn't get it'
- 'Come in' -> change in her tone shows a façade she has to put on
- ' I didn't know my daughter'
