Background research
		- Projectiles can be split up into vectors, separated by the axis of the movement. As seen in Chapter 10 'Projectile Motion' Cambridge Extension 1 textbook.
		- Time of flight of projectile should be the same if the hypothesis is true
	- Objective
		- Determine if horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. 
		- Determine if gravity acts the same on a moving object
	- Experiment
		- Push ball with velocity off a desk
		- Drop a ball using a trapdoor system in order to eliminate variance 
		- Record experiment perpendicular to the plane
		- Record in high fps / high shutter speed / slow motion to determine the time of flight accurately
		- Record in 240fps for better accuracy
			- 60 FPS = 1 frame every 16.6667 milliseconds (1000/60)
			- 240 FPS = 1 frame every 4.1667 milliseconds (1000/240)!

# Aim
To determine if the horizontal velocity of a projectile impacts the rate of change for the vertical velocity.
# Hypothesis
The vertical velocity is not affected by horizontal velocity and thus a the stationary projectile dropped and a moving projectile will fall in the same time

# Justification
Previous anecdotes of the bullet dropping in the same time as a feather in a vacuum environment. Projectiles can often be defined as a vector equation indicating that horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other.
# Methodology
## Method
1. Set the iPad camera on 240FPS 
2. Set iPad on a table directly facing the side view of the ball like seen in the image below.  
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250609223642.png]]
3. On top of an elevated platform, place a chair such that the front faces perpendicular to the elevated platform and it is not on an angle.
4. Measure using a ruler and make note of  note of the height from the ground to the elevated platform
5. Connect the hot wheels race track from the top of the chair to the edge of the platform using paper tape. See image below for guidance

6. Ensure the track is stable and does not move or shake when a ball is rolling down.
7. For stability, support the track below to ensure it will not bend downwards when the golf ball rolls down.
8. .Measure using a ruler and make note of the height of the top of race track to the platform
9. Put a blackboard slightly behind the path of ball.
10. Tape a 1 meter ruler on the blackboard, ensuring it is level and straight.
11. Start recording on the iPad
12. Drop the golf ball from the top of race track
13. Repeat step 12 10 times.
14. Stop the recording on the iPad
15. Start a new recording
16. Push the ball of the edge of the race track ensuring minimal horizontal velocity
17. Repeat step 16 10 times
## Apparatus
- 1x black school chair
- Blackboard
- 1 roll of paper tape
- 7x mini hot wheels race track -> the amount depends on the height you want to drop it at
- 6x connectors mini hot wheel track connectors -> the amount depends on the height you want to drop it at
- 1 meter ruler
- Measuring tape
- 1 standard golf ball
- iPad or a camera capable of 240FPS recording or higher
## Expected analysis
The setting of the hall is due to a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it has the required elevation to drop the ball. The platform is elevated 2.1m from the ground of the hall, fitting the parameters of the experiment. On top of that, the hall lights provide a higher lux count compared to typical LED light bulbs found in rooms. These strong stage lights are crucial for 2 reasons. Firstly due to how cameras work, the camera has to open and close at increased speeds to record in 240FPS, however as a side effect less light can enter when the shutter is open. However, if the light is brighter and more dense, it prevents an underexposed dark image which would be unusable. It is possible to compensate low light with a higher ISO however that comes with an issue of a noisy video which would ruin it as well. Hence the bright light increases image quality, increasing accuracy of the experiment. 

Setting the camera on 240FPS or higher will ensure a higher accuracy. The average chance of when the ball will start rolling would be in the middle of the frame which results in 8.333 milliseconds to the next frame when it would start moving on the camera. However when recording in 240FPS, the average chance of when it would appear in the frame is 2.08 milliseconds into the current frame, which results in only a 2.08ms difference when the ball rolls in real life and when it would show up in on the camera. 

The camera perpendicular to the plane, directly facing the side profile of the golf ball will ensure less camera warping. If viewing or recording from an angle, it would complicate it as there would be 3 dimensions involved instead of 2 if you viewed it flat on. It could also manipulate the speed of which the ball travels on the camera, if the ball is closer to the camera, then it would appear larger and have a faster speed in extreme cases.

The elevation is there to ensure it is above the height of 1.5m. Measuring and making note of the height allows for later calculations and for verification. Connecting the hot wheels track from the top of a school chair to the edge of the platform allows for a repeatable experiment. Ensuring it is stable allows for the best chance of staying on track and being repeatable, as well as allowing for the best speed.

The blackboard behind the path of the ball has a multitude of purposes. The ruler on the blackboard serves as a reference measurement for the tracking software Tracker. This allows for correct and accurate measurements. On top of that, the blackboard serves as a strong contrast behind the ball (white ball on black board), allowing for an easier auto tracking from tracker. 

Pushing the ball off of the edge of the track should result in minimal horizontal velocity whilst maintaining the same vertical height. As seen in the aim, it is still measuring the affect of which horizontal velocity has upon vertical velocity. The little horizontal velocity can be negated and ignored for the experiment.

It is important to repeat these experiments a multitude of times to see if they yield consistent results.

Using sound whilst analysing the videos provides a secondary source of verification the ball has hit the ground. Because the speed of sound at that distance is negligible and instant, using sound as well as visuals to verify the time will help improve analysis.
## Potential issues
- Lack of control, due to pushing the ball off of the edge of the platform this creates inconsistent control. Though this can be neglected as it shouldn't affect the results, it would be best to incorporate a 0 velocity control.
- The track could be set up inconsistently however, this should not hinder the results as if the hypothesis is true, horizontal velocity should have no affect onto the vertical velocity and thus they should fall at the same rate.
