Background research
		- Projectiles can be split up into vectors, separated by the axis of the movement. As seen in Chapter 10 'Projectile Motion' Cambridge Extension 1 textbook.
		- Time of flight of projectile should be the same if the hypothesis is true
	- Objective
		- Determine if horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. 
		- Determine if gravity acts the same on a moving object
	- Experiment
		- Push ball with velocity off a desk
		- Drop a ball using a trapdoor system in order to eliminate variance 
		- Record experiment perpendicular to the plane
		- Record in high fps / high shutter speed / slow motion to determine the time of flight accurately
		- Record in 240fps for better accuracy
			- 60 FPS = 1 frame every 16.6667 milliseconds (1000/60)
			- 240 FPS = 1 frame every 4.1667 milliseconds (1000/240)!

# Aim
To determine if the horizontal velocity of a projectile impacts the rate of change for the vertical velocity.
# Hypothesis
The vertical velocity is not affected by horizontal velocity and thus a the stationary projectile dropped and a moving projectile will fall in the same time

# Justification
Previous anecdotes of the bullet dropping in the same time as a feather in a vacuum environment. Projectiles can often be defined as a vector equation indicating that horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other.
# Methodology
## Method
1. Set the iPad camera on 240FPS 
2. Set iPad on a table directly facing the side view of the ball like seen in the image below.

3. On top of an elevated platform, place a chair such that the front faces perpendicular to the elevated platform and it is not on an angle.
4. Measure using a ruler and make note of  note of the height from the ground to the elevated platform
5. Connect the hot wheels race track from the top of the chair to the edge of the platform using paper tape
6. Ensure the track is stable and does not move or shake when a ball is rolling down.
7. For stability, support the track below to ensure it will not bend downwards when the golf ball rolls down.
8. .Measure using a ruler and make note of the height of the top of race track to the platform
9. Start recording on the iPad
10. Drop the golf ball from the top of race track
11. Repeat step 10 10 times.
12. Stop the recording on the iPad
13. Start a new recording
14. Push the ball of the edge of the race track ensuring minimal horizontal velocity
15. Repeat step 14 10 times
## Apparatus
- 1x black school chair
- 1 roll of paper tape
- 7x mini hot wheels race track -> the amount depends on the height you want to drop it at
- 6x connectors mini hot wheel track connectors -> the amount depends on the height you want to drop it at
- 1 meter ruler
- Measuring tape
- 1 standard golf ball
- iPad or a camera capable of 240FPS recording or higher
