Background research
		- Projectiles can be split up into vectors, separated by the axis of the movement. As seen in Chapter 10 'Projectile Motion' Cambridge Extension 1 textbook.
		- Time of flight of projectile should be the same if the hypothesis is true
	- Objective
		- Determine if horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. 
		- Determine if gravity acts the same on a moving object
	- Experiment
		- Push ball with velocity off a desk
		- Drop a ball using a trapdoor system in order to eliminate variance 
		- Record experiment perpendicular to the plane
		- Record in high fps / high shutter speed / slow motion to determine the time of flight accurately
		- Record in 240fps for better accuracy
			- 60 FPS = 1 frame every 16.6667 milliseconds (1000/60)
			- 240 FPS = 1 frame every 4.1667 milliseconds (1000/240)!

# Aim
To determine if the horizontal velocity of a projectile impacts the rate of change for the vertical velocity.
# Hypothesis
The vertical velocity is not affected by horizontal velocity and thus a the stationary projectile dropped and a moving projectile will fall in the same time

# Justification
Previous anecdotes of the bullet dropping in the same time as a feather in a vacuum environment. Projectiles can often be defined as a vector equation indicating that horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other.
# Methodology
## Method
1. Set the iPad camera on 240FPS 
2. Set iPad on a table directly facing the side view of the ball like seen in the image below.

3. On top of an elevated platform, place a chair such that it faces front perpendicular to the elevated platform.
## Apparatus
- 1x black school chair
- 1 roll of paper tape
- 7x mini hot wheels race track
- 6x connectors mini hot wheel track connectors
- 1 meter ruler
- 1 standard golf ball
- iPad or a camera capable of 240FPS recording or higher
