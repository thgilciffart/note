# Check Point 1
- ==**What is the best material for reducing the coefficient of friction between a metal mass and a classroom table?**==
	- Material of science lab tables [^1]
		- Epoxy resin (petroleum based)
		- Phenolic resin (petroleum based)
	- Potential lubricants / materials
		- PTFE [^2]
		- UHMW-PE[^3]
		- WD-40 Specialist Dry 
	- Types of friction
		- Dynamic -> coefficient of friction when an object is moving
		- Static -> determines force required to begin an objects movement
	- Potential ways to do experiment
		- Clean application of WD-40 for 5 trials
		- Use cut out of PTFE and UMHW-PE and stick it on each corner onto metal mass similar to mouse skates
		- Table on an decline
	- Background research
		- WD-40 can used as a lubricant
		- PTFE and UHMW-PE used as low friction materials to stick on objects such as non stick pans
	- Potential hypothesis and aim
		- WD-40 will greatly reduce the coefficient of friction between the metal mass and classroom table compared to other low friction materials and nothing
		- To determine what the best material or lubricant will be best in reducing the coefficient of friction between the classroom table and a metal mass
	- Materials required
		- Double sided tape
		- Thin PTFE sheets
		- Thin UHMW-PE sheets
		- Classroom table
		- 500g metal mass
		- inclinometer (to measure the incline / decline)
		- WD-40 Specialist dry 
- ==**Measure the potential energy and the kinetic energy changes of a pendulum.**==
	- Background research
- ==Does a projectile fired horizontally fall at the same rate as a projectile dropped from the same height (at least 1.5m)? ==
	- Background research
		- Projectiles can be split up into vectors, separated by the axis of the movement. As seen in Chapter 10 'Projectile Motion' Cambridge Extension 1 textbook.
		- Time of flight of projectile should be the same if the hypothesis is true
	- Objective
		- Determine if horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. 
		- Determine if gravity acts the same on a moving object
	- Experiment
		- Push ball with velocity off a desk
		- Drop a ball using a trapdoor system in order to eliminate variance 
		- Record experiment perpendicular to the plane
		- Record in high fps / high shutter speed / slow motion to determine the time of flight accurately
- ==Analysis of projectile motion of a marble or other projectile launched using Video Capture==
	- Experiment
		- Record perpendicular to the plane firing
		- Record in 240fps for better accuracy
			- 60 FPS = 1 frame every 16.6667 ms (1000/60)
			- 240 FPS = 1 frame every 4.1667 ms (1000/240)![[Pasted image 20250525182248.png]]
		- Creating a replicable firing machine
		- Take the video and plot it in software such as [Tracker](https://opensourcephysics.github.io/tracker-website/).
	- Objective
		- Research the shape and curve that the marble follows
	- Recording perpendicular to the plane will result in less perspective warp
	- Recording at a distance will reduce perspective warp
