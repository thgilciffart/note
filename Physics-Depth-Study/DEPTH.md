# Check Point 1
- ==**What is the best material for reducing the coefficient of friction between a metal mass and a classroom table?**== 16/05/25
	- Material of science lab tables [^1]
		- Epoxy resin (petroleum based)
		- Phenolic resin (petroleum based)
	- Potential lubricants / materials
		- PTFE [^2]
		- UHMW-PE[^3]
		- WD-40 Specialist Dry 
	- Types of friction
		- Dynamic --> coefficient of friction when an object is moving
		- Static --> determines force required to begin an objects movement
	- Potential ways to do experiment
		- Clean application of WD-40 for 5 trials
		- Use cut out of PTFE and UMHW-PE and stick it on each corner onto metal mass similar to mouse skates
		- Table on an decline
	- Background research
		- WD-40 can used as a lubricant
		- PTFE and UHMW-PE used as low friction materials to stick on objects such as non stick pans
	- Potential hypothesis and aim
		- WD-40 will greatly reduce the coefficient of friction between the metal mass and classroom table compared to other low friction materials and nothing
		- To determine what the best material or lubricant will be best in reducing the coefficient of friction between the classroom table and a metal mass
	- Materials required
		- Double sided tape
		- Thin PTFE sheets
		- Thin UHMW-PE sheets
		- Classroom table
		- 500g metal mass
		- inclinometer (to measure the incline / decline)
		- WD-40 Specialist dry 
- ==**Measure the potential energy and the kinetic energy changes of a pendulum.**== 20/05/25
	- Background research
- ==Does a projectile fired horizontally fall at the same rate as a projectile dropped from the same height (at least 1.5m)?==  23/05/25
	- Background research
		- Projectiles can be split up into vectors, separated by the axis of the movement. As seen in Chapter 10 'Projectile Motion' Cambridge Extension 1 textbook.
		- Time of flight of projectile should be the same if the hypothesis is true
	- Objective
		- Determine if horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. 
		- Determine if gravity acts the same on a moving object
	- Experiment
		- Push ball with velocity off a desk
		- Drop a ball using a trapdoor system in order to eliminate variance 
		- Record experiment perpendicular to the plane
		- Record in high fps / high shutter speed / slow motion to determine the time of flight accurately
- ==Analysis of projectile motion of a marble or other projectile launched using Video Capture== 25/05/25
	- Experiment
		- Record perpendicular to the plane firing
		- Record in 240fps for better accuracy
			- 60 FPS = 1 frame every 16.6667 milliseconds (1000/60)
			- 240 FPS = 1 frame every 4.1667 milliseconds (1000/240)!![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250525200718.png]]
			- The figure above demonstrates the difference when recording in 240fps compared to 60fps. The average chance of when the ball will start rolling would be in the middle of the frame which results in 8.333 milliseconds to the next frame when it would start moving on the camera. However when recording in 240FPS, the average chance of when it would appear in the frame is 2.08 milliseconds into the current frame, which results in only a 2.08ms difference when the ball rolls in real life and when it would show up in on the camera.
			- Video analysis tools such as Tracker, would also benefit with the additional samples of data, with a smoother curve compared to 60FPS
		- Creating a replicable firing machine
			- 
		- Take the video and plot it in software such as [Tracker](https://opensourcephysics.github.io/tracker-website/).
	- Objective
		- Aim - Research the shape and potential curve that the marble follows
		- Hypothesis - the ball will follow a parabolic concave down curve.
	- Recording perpendicular to the plane will result in less perspective warp
	- Recording at a distance will reduce perspective warp
