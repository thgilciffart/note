- Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another
- This means that the total energy present in the Universe has been constant for all times
# Potential energy
- Stored energy
- Such as elastic chemical gravitational potential energy
- gravitational potential energy is encountered when moving within a gravitational field
- energy is stored whenever work is done against the field or force producing medium
- the energy is stored in the field or medium generating the force
- for gravitational potential energy the energy is stored in the gravitational field
- mgh
# falling objects and the relationship between kinetic and gravitational potential energy
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta KE&=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \\
\Delta GPE

# inclined plane
- a mass sliding down an inclined plane experiences an acceleration of g sin theta
- it can be shown that the speed of a mass that slides from the top to the bottom of the slide is v=sqrt2gh
